    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman were designed by Charles and Ray Eames in 1956 for Herman Miller. Their goal was to create a modern chair with the warm, inviting look of a well-used baseball mitt. It quickly became a symbol of luxury and comfort in mid-century modern design.</p>

    <h2>Design Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Molded plywood shell crafted using innovative techniques</li>
      <li>Rich leather upholstery for durability and comfort</li>
      <li>15° permanent recline for ergonomic support</li>
      <li>Iconic five-star swivel base on the chair</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Different Models & Finishes</h2>
    <p>Over the decades, the Eames Lounge has been released in several finishes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Original Rosewood</strong> — the classic and most recognizable finish</li>
      <li><strong>Walnut</strong> — warm and widely available today</li>
      <li><strong>White Ash</strong> — a lighter, modern interpretation</li>
      <li><strong>Black Ash</strong> — a contemporary, dramatic finish</li>
